Version 0.4.6 (unreleased)
 o Added -D_REENTRANT for systems where this isn't the default, so that
   a per-thread errno will be used.

Version 0.4.5
 o Added jni compilation support for Darwin.

Version 0.4.4

 o Added separate default source/target values for library and example
   code(1.3 and 1.5 respectively).

 o Fixed a race condition in the Ping.java example program that was
   introduced after converting it from synchronous to asynchronous
   send/receives.

Version 0.4.3

 o On Win32, if a RawSocket was created and used before any java.net
   classes/methods, the JVM would crash.  This is resolved by having
   RawSocket call WSAStartup in its static class initializer and
   adding a shutdown hook that calls WSACleanup.  Unfortunately, the
   shutdown hook makes J2SE 1.3 the new compatibility baseline.

 o Eliminated compiler warnings related to signedness in JNI code.

Version 0.4.2

 o Made minor improvements to GNU Makefile under Cygwin.  JDK_HOME is
   adjusted with cygpath and uname is used to detect Cygwin environment.

 o Renamed compilation properties to use javac as prefix (e.g., source
   becomes javac.source).  Also added javac.target compilation
   property to set the version of the targeted JVM class file format.

 o Added compile.classes and jar.only build targets to build only the
   Java source code without also compiling the JNI code.

 o Improved error messages on Win32 (now use FormatMessage instead of
   strerror).

Version 0.4.1

 o Added socket send/receive timeout emulation using select() if the
   platform does not support SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO (e.g., Solaris).
   See RawSocket.setUseSelectTimeout(boolean) for details.

 o Changed argument checks in RawSocket.write and RawSocket.read
   so that zero-length packets can be written or read.

Version 0.4.0

 o Corrected cygwin compilation problem.  The -mno-cygwin option for gcc
   wasn't being enabled when the JNI Makefile was executed by Ant.

 o Added instructions for compiling with J2SE 1.4/1.3/1.2

 o Added socket option setters and getters for send/receive timeout,
   send/receive buffer size, and IP header include.

 o Changed default Winsock (wsock32) linking to Winsock2 (ws2_32) and
   added jni.winsock property to specify which library to use.

Version 0.3.1

 o Corrected minor errors in build documentation.

Version 0.3.0

 o Added support for building with Visual C++.

 o Added jni.make, jni.cc, and jni.makefile properties to
   build.properties.  These can be used to configure the commands
   used to build the JNI source code.
   
Version 0.2.2

 o Corrected error in license information embedded in source code.

Version 0.2.1

 o Corrected packaging mistake that omitted NOTICE file.

Version 0.2.0

 o Adjusted JNI code to compile on Win32 with Cygwin/MinGW.  You
   must have both Cygwin and MinGW installed with support for
   the Cygwin gcc -mno-cygwin option.  Visual C++ support will
   be added in a future release.

 o Changed Ping.java example to wait until first echo request is
   sent before trying to receive echo replies.  Otherwise, Windows
   will produce WSAETIMEDOUT errors, causing IOExceptions.
